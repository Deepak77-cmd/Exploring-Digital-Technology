The five main functional units in a computer are as follows:
Input unit: gives info to the computer to process. (eg. keyboard). 
Output unit: the processed data or result given. (eg. monitor).
Memory unit: store data. (eg. RAM & ROM).
     >>>RAM(Random Access Memory): store data temporarily
     >>>ROM(Read Only Memory): store data permanently.
Arithmetic Logic Unit: Calculations and Logical operations.

ALU and CU are combined as the processor that works with the memory unit and I/O unit to process, manage, and give result.
