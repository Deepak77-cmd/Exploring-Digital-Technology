Binary numbers are essential to communicate with computer, as computers rely on these digits to function and offer a simple and easy way for computer to work.
Let’s break down the process of converting a positive decimal number to binary.

Decimal Number to Binary:
i)   Divide the number by 2.
ii)  Record the remainder.
iii) Repeat the process with the quotient until it becomes 0.
iv)  Write the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation.

Example: Convert 45 to Binary
i)   45 ÷ 2 = 22, remainder 1
ii)  22 ÷ 2 = 11, remainder 0
iii) 11 ÷ 2 = 5, remainder 1
iv)   5 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 1
v)    2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0
vi)   1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Therefore, the binary representation of 45 is 101101.

Verification of the Decimal to Binary Conversion:

i)   (1 × 2⁵) = 32
ii)  (0 × 2⁴) = 0
iii) (1 × 2³) = 8
iv)  (1 × 2²) = 4
v)   (0 × 2¹) = 0
vi)  (1 × 2⁰) = 1

Adding up: 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 45
Thus, 101101 in binary equals 45 in decimal.

Two’s Complement (8-bit): Negative values in binary are represented using two’s complement, which simplifies arithmetic operations.

Steps to Find 2’s Complement:

i)   Write the positive binary equivalent (using a fixed bit-length, e.g., 8 bits).
ii)  Invert all bits (0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
iii) Add 1 to the inverted binary number.

Example: Convert -45 to Two’s Complement (8-bit)

Step 1: 45 in binary (8-bit): 00101101
Step 2: Invert the bits: 11010010
Step 3: Add 1: 11010011

Therefore, -45 in two’s complement (8-bit) is 11010011.
