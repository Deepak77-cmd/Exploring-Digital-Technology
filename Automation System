Key Components of an Automation System:
Reference Input (r): The system's desired setpoint or target value.

Error Summation: Computes the error (e = r-y) by comparing the reference input with the actual output.

Controller: Processes the error signal and calculates the corrective action needed.

System: Executes the control action to produce the output (y).

Disturbance Input: External, uncontrollable factors that can affect system performance.

Measurement: Monitors the output and feeds it back for comparison.

Feedback Loop: Continuously adjusts the system to maintain stability and accuracy by comparing output with input.
