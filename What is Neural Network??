Neural Networks ‚Äì a fundamental idea in machine learning that mimics how our brains work, but in a simplified way.
-Neural networks is a huge network of artificial neurons that pass signals to each other. These signals get stronger or weaker based on something called weights (importance scores for connections).
-they are used in wide range of applications such as: image recognition, Language tranlation, Game Playing, Speech processing.

Key Components:
Neurons (Nodes): Basic units that perform computations.

Layers:

Input Layer: Receives raw data (e.g., pixels, text).

Hidden Layers: Extract features (deep networks have many).

Output Layer: Produces predictions (e.g., classification).

Weights & Biases: Adjustable parameters learned during training.

Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU).

-Why They're Useful:
#Learn directly from raw data

#Detect complex patterns in data.

#Get better with experience and improve their performance (training)

# hadle large datasets. 

#Each neuron passes information to the next, and the network learns by adjusting how strong these connections are.

üóíÔ∏è Personal Reflection
At first, neural networks felt very difficult, But understanding their structure made it feel more mechanical and logical.
I‚Äôm especially interested in how they adapt over time and improve, just like human learning.
