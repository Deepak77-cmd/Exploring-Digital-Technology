Neural Networks – a fundamental idea in machine learning that mimics how our brains work, but in a simplified way.
-Neural networks is a huge network of artificial neurons that pass signals to each other. These signals get stronger or weaker based on something called weights (importance scores for connections).
-they are used in wide range of applications such as: image recognition, Language tranlation, Game Playing, Speech processing.

-Why They're Useful:
#Learn directly from raw data

#Detect complex patterns in data.

#Get better with experience and improve their performance (training)

# hadle large datasets.

-How They’re Built:
A typical neural network has three main parts:

Input Layer – receives the raw data (like an image or sentence) 

Hidden Layers – process the data using mathematical function

Output Layer – gives the final answer 

Each neuron passes information to the next, and the network learns by adjusting how strong these connections are.

🗒️ Personal Reflection
At first, neural networks felt very difficult, But understanding their structure made it feel more mechanical and logical.
I’m especially interested in how they adapt over time and improve, just like human learning.
