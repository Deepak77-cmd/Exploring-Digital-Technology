Ethical Issues in Automation:
- Bias and discrimination: systems can inherit biases from their training data, which may lead to unfair decisions.

- Job Displacement and Economic Inequality: Automation may lead to many layoffs in different industries specially jobs related to 
  cold calls, service centers, data entry jobs, etc, which may make the corporations rich and production become more cost efficient 
                                            but many people will face economic insecurity.

- Lack of Accountability: where an automated system takes a biased decision or a harful decision, it can be unclear who is responsible for that, is it the owner or is it that 
  company who is providing technological service or product. for instance- if a self driving can get in an accident while self driving mode was on, who will take the blame??

- Surveillance and privacy: Automated systems mainly used to manage heavy data collection, which also raises concerns about people's privacy.

- Environmental impact: Building and running a system specially a AI system consume massive energy resources contributes to climate change.

Address these challeges: 
- Transition Plans: Government and companies should invest in reskilling and make a social safety net.
- Algorithmic checks: Regular checks can help in ensuring that a system should remain fair and unbiased.
- Privacy Protection Laws: Stronger regulation abround data misuse and privacy rights.
